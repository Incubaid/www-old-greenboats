Comparison of catamarans.
We like all boats mentioned on this page but want to demonstrate how boats can have a different mission and target market.

If you don't agree with the comparison please send us your remarks to info@greenboats.com

# The 100% perfect boat does not exist.
- Performance
 * Performance of a heavy boat is +- the hull speed for a catamaran in this range this would be around 10 knots. Even if the winds pick up the boat will not go much higher than the hullspeed.
 * Heavy for this size means +20 Ton
 * Super light boats can achieve 25 knots with good wind.
- Price
 * A very important criteria. A boat of this size will cost between 800.000 eur and 2.000.000 eur (with options included)
 * A super light boat costs a lot of money because of required construction techniques & special materials.
 * remark many brands sell their boats with minimal options, we try to compare with all options required to get a balanced, comfortable and fun boat.
- Safety
 * All catamarans are safe today if used well.
 * The lighter and the lower the point of gravity the safer the boat will be in heavy sea & wind conditions.
 * While a flybridge is ideal from a comfort perspective it is a killer feature from a safety & performance perspective.
- Living Space & Comfort
 * Typically the smaller the hulls are the more performance can be expected but this results in less living space. Choices will have to be made.
 * A big and spacious boat can never be high performance.
- Automation, Communication & IT systems
 * This is a very under served requirement for most boats. This is the area where we want to excel in GreenBoats
 * Features like
     *  Auto Check Of All Components (does not exist on any boat available in the market today(
     *  Always on Internet Connection while using 1/10 of bandwidth (keep you monthly satellite bill low)
     *  All systems 100% integrated & controlled by 1 system (on most boats + 10 control systems need to be used & maintained)
     *  Multimedia system in each room
     *  Special safety features because of integration with services on internet (e.g. weather reports)

- Green
 * A sailing boat should be green? Unfortunately most are not.
 * This is "the" other specialty of Green Boats.
 * Green is more than just installing solar panels.
 * Check requirements like:
	 *	which batteries used (lead acid batteries are too heavy, capacity of batteries)
	 *	ouput of solar panels normally very low (like 50 watt per m2, no by no means enough to power a boat)
	 *	watermakers are a must but how reliable & power efficient are they
	 *	airco: the most power hungry application, the only choice today, have one or not (we are working on a solution)

- Nice charter boats if you are looking for a very comfortable & spacy catamaran.
- A great flybridge with lots of space.
- Price/quality/value relationship is very good.
- The boat is not optimized for performance, because of size & weight of boat.

- Lagoon is the market leader for charter boats.

# Private faster travel catamaran (go around the world)

- The quality & finishing is very good.
- The boat has as main requirements: safety, quality & performance.
- The price/quality/value relationship is very good.
- Less space when compared to e.g. a Lagoon 560. No flybridge.
- This is probably the most cost effective high performance catamaran optimized for sailing.

# Fast super light sport catamaran

- Super high performance boat. All carbon & special materials.
- If you are looking for the fastest boat this could be it.
- Quite expensive though.

# GreenBoat: greenest, fast, ultra comfortable family boat
![image](/images/TheGreenCat.JPG")

- A new kind of boat with different accents, made for the people who want comfort, safety & performance at reasonable price.
- The GreenCat is based on the Nautitech 54.
- But Greenboats is more performant because of sails & lighter rotating mast used.
- This is probably the greenest boat available in the market.
