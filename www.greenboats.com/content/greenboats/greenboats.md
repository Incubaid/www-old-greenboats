The boat is the most aesthetic and superior of this category thanks to her thin lines and her interior design done by the French designer Frank Darnet, combined with unique high end and green technology by IT automation specialist Kristof De Spiegeleer. In a word, a vessel made to live and sail!

### A revolutionary concept
Not each boat can be good in everything. You have boats that are the most energy efficient, those typically will not be the best performers in speed. Our dream of bringing boats to a next level is about combining the best of all boats into a single boat: Combining high tech comfort with energy saving technologies, making our boat greener and more enjoyable than ever, without making concessions to performance and reliability.
